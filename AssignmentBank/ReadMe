The current directory hold three java files:
  1. Bank.java (It only contains the most basic details of the bank)
  2. Customer.java (It constains the details related to the Customer's account in the bank)
  3. CustomerList.java (This class is used for the purpose of creating the LinkedList of Customer type objects)
  
Feel free to contact me for issues regarding the code.
